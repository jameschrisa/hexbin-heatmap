# Hexbin Heatmap Visualization Project

## Project Overview

This project implements an interactive hexbin heatmap visualization using Vue.js and D3.js. The heatmap displays data density using hexagonal bins, with a color scale representing different levels of concentration. Users can interact with the visualization through a color legend, allowing them to filter the display based on specific density levels.

## Technical Specifications

### Technologies Used

- Vue.js 3: Front-end framework
- D3.js: Data visualization library
- Vite: Build tool and development server

### Key Components

1. **HexbinHeatmap.vue**: Main component that renders the entire visualization.
2. **ColorLegend.vue**: Component for the interactive color legend.
3. **useHexbinVisualization.js**: Composable for creating the hexbin visualization using D3.js.
4. **hexbinUtils.js**: Utility functions for data generation and color scaling.
5. **config.js**: Configuration file for visualization parameters.

## Scope and Functionality

- Generate a hexbin heatmap based on random data points.
- Implement a color scale to represent data density.
- Provide an interactive color legend for filtering the visualization.
- Allow customization of hexbin size, color scale, and overall dimensions.

## Context

This visualization is designed to represent data density in a 2D space using hexagonal bins. It's particularly useful for datasets with many points where individual point representation might be cluttered or overwhelming.

## Constraints

- The visualization is currently designed for web browsers and may not be optimized for mobile devices.
- Data is currently generated randomly; integration with real datasets would require additional development.
- The color scale and number of levels are fixed in the current implementation.

## Goals

1. Create an visually appealing and interactive heatmap visualization.
2. Provide a flexible and reusable component for hexbin heatmap visualizations.
3. Allow for easy customization of visual parameters through a configuration file.
4. Demonstrate the integration of Vue.js and D3.js for complex data visualizations.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement zooming and panning functionality.
- Add support for loading external datasets.
- Enhance mobile responsiveness.
- Implement additional interactivity features (e.g., tooltips, click events on hexbins).
- Allow dynamic adjustment of color scales and bin sizes.

## Configuration

The `config.js` file allows customization of various aspects of the visualization:

- Color scale and level labels
- Overall dimensions and margins
- Number of hexagons in X and Y directions
- Number of data points to generate

## Usage

To use this component in a Vue.js project:

1. Import the necessary components and utilities.
2. Include the `HexbinHeatmap` component in your template.
3. Customize the `config.js` file as needed.

Example:

```vue
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <HexbinHeatmap />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import HexbinHeatmap from './components/HexbinHeatmap.vue'

export default {
  name: 'App',
  components: {
    HexbinHeatmap
  }
}
</script>
```

## Development

To set up the project for development:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Use `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Make changes to the components or configuration as needed

## Conclusion

This hexbin heatmap project provides a foundation for creating interactive and visually appealing data density visualizations. It demonstrates the power of combining Vue.js for component-based development with D3.js for complex data visualizations. The project is designed to be extensible and customizable, allowing for future enhancements and adaptations to specific use cases.
